### LANDFIRE's Biophysical Settings (BpSs)

<br>

>*BpS models represent the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement. These models are based on a combination of the current environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime.* [Read more](https://landfire.gov/bps.php){target="blank"}.

Check out this 3-minute tutorial for a quick refresher on the [basics of Biophysical Settings Models](https://youtu.be/xjaWJCe7udQ){target="blank"}.


## Summary

* When clipping by the entire 8-state area we get tons of prairie types that would be mostly abscent if I had clipped to GLRI boundary, or totally missing if I had filtered for only "Forest" types.
* As expected northern hardwoods types dominated in terms of forested BpSs.
* If non-forested types are removed, there will still be substantial fire-adapted BpSs in the GLRI boundary, such as the North-Central Interior Dry-Mesic Oak Forest and Woodland.


## Most Prevalent Biophysical Settings

Here I mapped only the BpSs that represented > 3% of the entire area, and did not filter by forested types. While not perfect colors were selected for accessibility.  The map will be improved by reducing the number of types represented and/or splitting the map into multiple, e.g., 'riparian' and 'upland'.

In the chart below the top 10 BpSs are shown, again including all types (i.e., not filtered for forested).


```{r bps chart, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(stringr)

bps_data <- read.csv("data/bps_atts_r.csv")

bpsname <- bps_data %>%
  group_by(BPS_NAME) %>%
  summarize(ACRES = sum(ACRES),
            REL_PERCENT = sum(REL_PERCENT)) %>%
  arrange(desc(REL_PERCENT)) %>%
  subset(BPS_NAME != "Open Water" & BPS_NAME != "Barren-Rock/Sand/Clay") %>%
  distinct(BPS_NAME, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = REL_PERCENT) 

# plot
bpsChart <- 
  ggplot(data = bpsname, aes(x = BPS_NAME, y = REL_PERCENT)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Biophysical Settings",
    caption = "Data from landfire.gov",
    x = "",
    y = "Percent of landscape") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(bpsname$BPS_NAME),
                   labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 18)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)

## Historic Annual Acres Burned (per ecosystem)

The historical fire chart and map come from the Biophysical Settings spatial data, which has historical fire attributes imported from the BpS state and transition models. 

```{r fire bar, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
# read bps attribute table .csv and summarize
annualFire <- bps_data %>%
  mutate(annual_fire_acres = ((1/FRI_ALLFIR)*ACRES)) %>%
  filter(BPS_NAME != 'Open Water') %>%
  group_by(BPS_NAME) %>%
  summarize(acres = sum(annual_fire_acres)) %>%
  arrange(desc(acres)) %>%
  top_n(n = 10, wt = acres)

# plot
fireChart <- 
  ggplot(data = annualFire, aes(x = BPS_NAME, y = acres)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#6e434c") +
  labs(
    title = "Cumulative estimates of all fire types prior to pre-European colonization",
    caption = "Data from landfire.gov",
    x = "",
    y = "Acres") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(annualFire$BPS_NAME),
                   labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 18)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = 'Acres', labels = comma) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(10, 30, 0, 0))

# if the plot looks good, save it
ggsave("./OUTPUTS/fireChart.png", width = 12, height = 5)
